0:00:02.510 --> 0:00:05.010
I like to focus on what you

0:00:05.080 --> 0:00:07.580
do before you go into a stressful presentation.

0:00:07.570 --> 0:00:10.070
Of course,

0:00:08.190 --> 0:00:10.690
inevitably people are going to ask,

0:00:10.470 --> 0:00:12.970
what do you do during the presentation?

0:00:12.380 --> 0:00:14.880
If you have that moment where your heart starts

0:00:15.160 --> 0:00:17.660
racing,

0:00:16.180 --> 0:00:18.680
your mouth is going dry,

0:00:17.450 --> 0:00:19.950
your face is getting red,

0:00:19.210 --> 0:00:21.710
you know,

0:00:20.070 --> 0:00:22.570
probably from your own experience how quickly that goes into

0:00:22.670 --> 0:00:25.170
a kind of death spiral,

0:00:24.390 --> 0:00:26.890
so i want to tell you that you actually have the control

0:00:27.180 --> 0:00:29.680
to pull yourself out of that,

0:00:29.180 --> 0:00:31.680
and what you need to do is pause

0:00:31.730 --> 0:00:34.230
and collect your thoughts.

0:00:33.250 --> 0:00:35.750
That's ok?

0:00:34.260 --> 0:00:36.760
It does not come across as painfully

0:00:36.950 --> 0:00:39.450
awkward to other people,

0:00:38.370 --> 0:00:40.870
they actually see it as a sign of confidence.

0:00:41.620 --> 0:00:44.120
The second one slow

0:00:44.250 --> 0:00:46.750
your breathing,

0:00:45.390 --> 0:00:47.890
make sure it's deep trigger that relax

0:00:47.890 --> 0:00:50.390
ation response.

0:00:48.750 --> 0:00:51.250
This is about your nervous system,

0:00:50.560 --> 0:00:53.060
speaking to your brain and telling you that you're in a safe

0:00:53.210 --> 0:00:55.710
situation.

0:00 --> 0:00:56.500
Another thing that people do when they get nervous speaking as

0:00:56.560 --> 0:00:59.060
they start to collapse,

0:00:58.610 --> 0:01:01.110
they start to touch their arms and touch

0:01:01.140 --> 0:01:03.640
their faces in their necks,

0:01:02.830 --> 0:01:05.330
and they don't move around and they get what we call

0:01:05.510 --> 0:01:08.010
penguin arms,

0:01:06.260 --> 0:01:08.760
where they pin their upper arms to their bodies

0:01:08.870 --> 0:01:11.370
are afraid they don't know what to do with their arms,

0:01:11.750 --> 0:01:14.250
stop yourself from doing that here's,

0:01:13.560 --> 0:01:16.060
how you can do it.

0:01:15.400 --> 0:01:17.900
Hold something,

0:01:16.650 --> 0:01:19.150
have a slide advancer,

0:01:18.180 --> 0:01:20.680
hold it away from your body carry of water bottle

0:01:20.900 --> 0:01:23.400
or if you're standing at a podium,

0:01:23.130 --> 0:01:25.630
put your arms on the podium,

0:01:25.250 --> 0:01:27.750
do things that force you to hold

0:01:28.050 --> 0:01:30.550
your arms and your hands away from your body

0:01:31.010 --> 0:01:33.510
that will help you to feel more confident

0:01:33.810 --> 0:01:36.310
and powerful,

0:01:34.480 --> 0:01:36.980
and it will also signal to other people that you feel powerful

0:01:37.180 --> 0:01:39.680
and confident the key is.

0:01:39.020 --> 0:01:41.520
Don't let the primitive fighter flight part of your brain

0:01:41.750 --> 0:01:44.250
take over.

0:01:42.670 --> 0:01:45.170
You are not going to be very good at telling yourself to calm

0:01:45.430 --> 0:01:47.930
down,

0:01:45.680 --> 0:01:48.180
and we're very,

0:01:46.390 --> 0:01:48.890
very bad doing that.

0:01:48.040 --> 0:01:50.540
But your body can calm you down,

0:01:50.550 --> 0:01:53.050
so if you say calm down to yourself when you're

0:01:53.070 --> 0:01:55.570
anxious,

0:01:53.620 --> 0:01:56.120
you go,

0:01:53.990 --> 0:01:56.490
oh my gosh,

0:01:54.710 --> 0:01:57.210
i'm really,

0:01:55.170 --> 0:01:57.670
really anxious.

0:01:56.870 --> 0:01:59.370
So you get a kind of rebound,

0:01:58.720 --> 0:02:01.220
the anxiety.

0:01:59.720 --> 0:02:02.220
If you change your body language.

0:02:01.880 --> 0:02:04.380
Jj,

0:02:02.170 --> 0:02:04.670
you're walking yourself down away from that

0:02:04.750 --> 0:02:07.250
ledge,

0:02:05.650 --> 0:02:08.150
and that really comes and your nervous system

0:02:08.540 --> 0:02:11.040
and allows you to regain your composure.
